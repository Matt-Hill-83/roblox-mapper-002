6. ⬛ T6: Codebase Integration Analysis
   1. ✅ T6.1: Find the file in the codebase that generates object data
   2. ✅ T6.2: Determine what the created data looks like
   3. ✅ T6.3: Determine how the link data is created
   4. ✅ T6.4: Change the code to read the data from a .ts file
   5. ✅ T6.5: Determine if the code is agnostic to the data type and can handle our data
   6. ✅ T6.6: Pass in a sample of our data

7. ✅ T7: Test Data Preparation
   1. ✅ T7.1: Create a file called tempHarnessTestData.ts
   2. ✅ T7.2: Read the first 120 lines of harness-files.json and recreate that data in the new temp file

8. ✅ T8: Code Analysis Documentation
   1. ✅ T8.1: Create a doc called 000 - petType usage in code.md
   2. ✅ T8.2: Find everywhere in the code petType exists, and determine which of those are live code vs dead code
   3. ✅ T8.3: Note: The code may be tightly coupled to the old data structure


9. ⬛ T9: Make Axis Filters Dynamic
   1. ⬛ T9.1: Create property discovery system that reads all properties from data objects
   2. ⬛ T9.2: Remove hardcoded "type" and "petType" property assignments
   3. ⬛ T9.3: Implement dynamic property assignment:
      1. ⬛ T9.3.1: Assign first discovered property to Z axis by default
      2. ⬛ T9.3.2: Assign second discovered property to X axis by default
   4. ⬛ T9.4: Update GUI axis mapping controls to show all available properties
   5. ⬛ T9.5: Enable real-time property selection for each axis in the GUI
   6. ⬛ T9.6: Ensure code is fully data-type agnostic
   
   Note: Previously the data was a set of Person objects with hardcoded "type" and "petType" properties. This task adapts the code to work with any data structure.

10. ✅ T10: Z-Parallel Shadow Lane Length Standardization
    1. ✅ T10.1: Find the code that creates the z-parallel shadow lane lengths
    2. ✅ T10.2: Make them all the same length
    3. ✅ T10.3: Note the order of creation:
       1. Nodes and node swimlanes
       2. Z parallel shadows


11. ✅ T11: Unify Labels on Shadow Blocks
    1. ✅ T11.1: Find all label creation code for swimlane shadow blocks
    2. ✅ T11.2: Identify the different border width implementations
    3. ✅ T11.3: Create a common utility or constants for label styling
    4. ✅ T11.4: Update all label creation to use the unified approach

12. ✅ T12: Fix Dynamic Property Discovery Not Populating GUI Dropdowns
    1. ✅ T12.1: Debug why discovered properties aren't reaching the GUI
       - Added debug logging throughout the property discovery flow
       - Confirmed properties are being discovered and sent from server to client
    2. ✅ T12.2: Ensure property discovery happens before GUI initialization
       - Issue: GUI was created before data generation/property discovery
       - Solution: Added GUI refresh mechanism when properties are discovered
    3. ✅ T12.3: Update dropdown population timing
       - Added `refreshAxisDropdownGUI()` function to destroy and recreate dropdowns
       - Updated `updateDiscoveredProperties()` to force GUI refresh
    4. ✅ T12.4: Verify server-to-client communication of discovered properties
       - Confirmed server sends properties via `FireClient(player, "discoveredProperties", cluster.discoveredProperties)`
       - Confirmed client receives and processes properties correctly
    
    Resolution: The issue was that the axis dropdown GUI was created once and never refreshed when properties were discovered. Fixed by:
    - Adding `refreshAxisDropdownGUI()` to destroy the old dropdown GUI
    - Forcing a full GUI refresh when properties are discovered
    - This ensures dropdowns are populated with discovered properties (service, component, language, etc.)

13. ✅ T13: Fix Axis Mapping Dropdowns Still Showing Legacy Properties
    1. ✅ T13.1: Debug why the dropdown is still showing Person properties despite T12 fixes
       - Found that module-level constants were initialized with hardcoded legacy properties
       - Even though properties were updated, the dropdowns were using cached values
    2. ✅ T13.2: Check if the axis mapping GUI is being created before properties are updated
       - Confirmed: Constants were imported at module load time with legacy defaults
       - The GUI refresh was creating duplicate controls which still used old values
    3. ✅ T13.3: Ensure proper timing between property discovery and GUI creation
       - Removed duplicate control creation on GUI refresh
       - Implemented delayed creation of axis mapping controls
    4. ✅ T13.4: Implement a solution to ensure dropdowns show discovered properties
       - Changed from module-level constants to getter functions:
         - `AVAILABLE_PROPERTIES` → `getAvailableProperties()`
         - `VISUAL_PROPERTIES` → `getVisualProperties()`
       - Updated all files using these constants to use the getter functions
       - Updated axis mapping config to use the new discovered property values before creating controls
       - This ensures dropdowns show discovered properties AND use them as defaults
    
    Resolution: Fixed by replacing module-level constants with getter functions, removing duplicate control creation, and updating config values

14. ✅ T14: Remove Labels from Short Sides of Endcaps
    1. ✅ T14.1: Identify which faces are the "short" sides on endcap blocks
    2. ✅ T14.2: Modify endcap label creation to only add labels to long sides
    3. ✅ T14.3: Test with both X and Z axis endcaps

15. ✅ T15: Color Nodes According to Background Property from GUI
    1. ✅ T15.1: Identify where node colors are currently assigned
       - Found in nodeRenderer.ts line 96: already using getNodeBackgroundColor with visualMapping
    2. ✅ T15.2: Implement node coloring based on visual mapping background property
       - Code already exists but color schemes were missing for Harness properties
    3. ✅ T15.3: Set default background property to match Z-axis property
       - Added color schemes for: component, service, language, resourceDomain
    4. ✅ T15.4: Ensure color consistency between nodes and swimlanes
       - Note: Swimlanes use predefined color arrays, nodes use property-based colors
    5. ✅ T15.5: Test with different property selections in GUI
       - Color schemes now support all discovered Harness properties
    
    Resolution: Added color schemes for Harness properties in colorMapper.ts. The node coloring system was already implemented correctly but was missing color definitions for the new properties.

16. ✅ T16: Add Vertical Wall at Far Z Edge of Shadow Block
    1. ✅ T16.1: Find the existing vertical wall code
    2. ✅ T16.2: Understand how vertical walls are currently created
    3. ✅ T16.3: Adapt the code to create a single wall:
       - Parallel to X-axis
       - Positioned at the far Z edge of the shadow block
       - Same width as the shadow block
    4. ✅ T16.4: Integrate the wall creation with the shadow block rendering

17. ✅ T17: Create Documentation for Possible Link Types Between Harness Files
    1. ✅ T17.1: Review the harness-analyzer scripts to understand file extraction
    2. ✅ T17.2: Analyze the Harness codebase structure to identify relationships
    3. ✅ T17.3: Create "000 - possible link types.md" document
    4. ✅ T17.4: List and categorize various link types that could be documented between files

18. ✅ T18: Write a script to find the top 5 link types listed in the doc from t17. It should only record links between files currently listed in harness-files.json.

19. ✅ T19: Convert 1st 1000 lines of raw links file to a .ts file that can be consumed by the data generator in place of the fake links data.


20. create a plan to add vertical swimlanes and  add swimlane shadows on the walls
