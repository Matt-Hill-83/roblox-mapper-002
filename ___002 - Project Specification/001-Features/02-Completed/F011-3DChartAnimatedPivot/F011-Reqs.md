   1. ⬛ R100.1.1: Enable pivoting by entity type (e.g., reorganize by Animals, People, Buildings)
   2. ⬛ R100.1.2: Enable pivoting by relationship type (e.g., group by "owns", "maintains", "uses")
   3. ⬛ R100.1.3: Support multi-level pivoting (primary and secondary pivot axes)
   4. ⬛ R100.1.4: Maintain entity relationships during pivot transformations

## R101: Animation System

1. ⬛ R101.1: The system shall provide smooth animated transitions between pivot states
   1. ⬛ R101.1.1: Implement configurable animation duration (0.5s to 5s range)
   2. ⬛ R101.1.2: Support multiple easing functions (linear, ease-in-out, spring)
   3. ⬛ R101.1.3: Animate entity positions along optimal paths to avoid collisions
