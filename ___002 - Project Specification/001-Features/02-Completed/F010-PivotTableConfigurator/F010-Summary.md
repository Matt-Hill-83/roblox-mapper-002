# Feature 010: Pivot Table Layout Configurator Summary

## Overview
Advanced configuration interface that allows users to dynamically map entity properties to geometric features in the 3D visualization. Similar to pivot tables in spreadsheet applications, users can drag and drop properties to assign them to different visual dimensions and characteristics of the graph.

## Key Components
- **Property Inspector**: Dynamic discovery of all entity properties
- **Mapping Interface**: Drag-and-drop UI for property assignment
- **Geometric Dimensions**: X/Y/Z position, size, color, shape, grouping
- **Real-time Preview**: Immediate visual feedback of configuration changes
- **Configuration Persistence**: Save and load custom mapping presets

## Implementation Status
- ⬛ Requirements defined
- ⬛ Implementation pending

## Technical Approach
- Dynamic property introspection of entity data
- Flexible mapping system between properties and visual features
- GUI with draggable property tokens
- Real-time graph regeneration based on mappings
- Support for categorical and numerical property types

## Use Cases
- Map entity age to vertical position
- Map entity type to node color
- Map relationship count to node size
- Group entities by custom properties
- Create custom spatial arrangements based on data

## Dependencies
- Configuration GUI system
- Entity data structures
- Graph rendering system
- Roblox GUI components
