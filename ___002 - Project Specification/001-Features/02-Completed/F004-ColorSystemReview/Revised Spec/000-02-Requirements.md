# Color System Review - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. ⬛ R1: Analyze all color definitions and their locations in the codebase
   - Search for Color3 instantiations
   - Identify color constant files
   - Document import/export patterns

2. ⬛ R2: Document color usage patterns across different components
   - Map colors to visual components (nodes, swimlanes, shadows)
   - Track color assignment methods (sequential, mapped, hardcoded)
   - Analyze color propagation through the system

3. ⬛ R3: Identify redundant or inconsistent color definitions
   - Find duplicate color values
   - Identify naming inconsistencies
   - Document scattered color definitions

4. ⬛ R4: Create a comprehensive table of all colors with their usage context
   - Color name/identifier
   - RGB values
   - Component usage
   - File location

5. ⬛ R5: Generate visual diagrams showing color relationships and hierarchies
   - Component-to-color mapping diagram
   - Color inheritance flow chart
   - Color usage frequency visualization

6. ⬛ R6: Provide actionable recommendations for color system improvements
   - Centralization strategies
   - Naming conventions
   - Theme system architecture
   - Implementation roadmap

7. ⬛ R7: Focus on Roblox-specific code (src/ directory, excluding _webapp)
   - Analyze TypeScript source files
   - Exclude compiled Luau output
   - Exclude web application code

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Report should be clear and actionable
- Recommendations should prioritize maintainability
- Analysis should be comprehensive but focused
- Output should include both technical details and high-level overview
