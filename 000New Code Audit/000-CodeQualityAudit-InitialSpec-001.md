# Code Quality Audit Specification

## Summary

Comprehensive code quality audit of the Roblox Mapper 002 project to assess current code quality, identify improvement opportunities, and ensure maintainability standards.

## Requirements

1. **File Inventory**
   - Scan all TypeScript files in the project
   - Collect metrics: file size, line count, last modified date
   - Identify largest and most complex files

2. **Code Analysis**
   - Check for type annotation coverage
   - Identify naming convention violations
   - Measure cyclomatic complexity
   - Detect duplicate code patterns
   - Map module dependencies

3. **Architecture Review**
   - Analyze module structure and dependencies
   - Identify circular dependencies
   - Assess separation of concerns
   - Review interface definitions

4. **Report Generation**
   - Generate comprehensive markdown report
   - Include visual dependency graphs
   - Provide prioritized recommendations
   - Create actionable improvement tasks
