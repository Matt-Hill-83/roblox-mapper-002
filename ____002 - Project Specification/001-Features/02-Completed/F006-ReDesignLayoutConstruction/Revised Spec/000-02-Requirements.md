# F006 - ReDesign Layout Construction Requirements

1. ⬛ R1: Create X-parallel lanes first with length driven by placing all nodes next to each other in a line parallel to the X axis
2. ⬛ R2: Create Z-parallel lanes second with width driven by arbitrary lane width and inter-lane spacing  
3. ⬛ R3: Create the group shadow block last, sized to encompass all lanes
4. ⬛ R4: Define fixed lane widths and buffer sizes as constants
5. ⬛ R5: Content must adapt to fit within fixed lane dimensions rather than driving block size
6. ⬛ R6: Maintain visual consistency regardless of node count or distribution

## Risks

- Risk 1: Breaking existing visualizations - mitigate with careful testing of various node configurations
- Risk 2: Performance impact from recalculating dimensions - mitigate by caching fixed values
- Risk 3: Visual regression if fixed dimensions are too small - mitigate with sensible defaults

## Decision Points

- Decision 1: Fixed lane width values - chose 10 units for Z-parallel lanes based on typical content
- Decision 2: Inter-lane spacing - chose 2 units for clear visual separation without excess space
- Decision 3: Shadow padding - chose 5 units to provide clear boundary around all content
