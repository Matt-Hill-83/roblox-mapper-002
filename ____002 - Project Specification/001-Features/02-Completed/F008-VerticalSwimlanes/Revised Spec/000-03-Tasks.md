6. ⬛ T9.6: Refactor dropdowns into grid
7. ✅ T9.7: Nix duplicate walls
8. ✅ T9.8: Push Y shadows to edge

   3. ✅ T9.8.3: Set spacing between y shadow blocks to 2

21. ✅ T9.21: Link colors
12. ✅ T9.12: Are we using real links, or fake data?
23. ✅ Create a duplicate yshadows stack
  1. ✅ Position it similarly, so that it is aligned with the other vertical wall and protrudes 1 unit into the node area

9. ⬛ T9.9: Create a table of buttons for selecting
10. ⬛ T9.10: Stacks and Y axis
11. ⬛ T9.11: Pass in default axis options from game.service
13. ⬛ T9.13: Create GUI manager

14. ⬛ T9.14: Remove path property from data set
15. ⬛ T9.15: Remove yellow labels on xparallel shadow blocks
16. ⬛ T9.16: Create an algo to map ascendency
17. ⬛ T9.17: Fix node popup gui
18. ⬛ T9.18: Create duplicate y shadow stack
20. ⬛ T9.20: Add treeLevel as a property
22. ⬛ T9.22: Data summary gui with num nodes, links
23. ⬛ T9.23: Remove the layer table from the configgui
24. ✅ T9.24: Create a new property named treeLevel and add it to the data
    1. ✅ T9.24.1: Collect a Set of all unique link types and print them to the console, along with number of each found
    2. ✅ T9.24.2: Use this information to assign parent-child directionality to the links
    3. ✅ T9.24.3: When the data is connected with its links, create an algo that will assign a node with no parent the treeLevel = 0. It's first child will have a value of 1. If a node has multiple parents, its treeValue is the highest of the treeValues it inherits. We want to be able to use this value to sort the nodes in the y direction
25. ⬛ T9.25: Create a table of link types that can be toggled, and the data will recalculate
26. ✅ T9.26: Create a read only gui that shows every unique link type and the count of how many times it appeared
27. ⬛ T9.27: Add button to toggle which lanes are higher
28. ✅ T9.28: Add a function to filter the links object and only keep records that have Import as the type
29. ⬛ T9.29: Create gui for all props and which to ignore
30. ✅ T9.30: In game.ts pass in default configuration object
    1. ✅ T9.30.1: Set initial values for the gui with object containing:
        - xgroup: component
        - zgroup: server
        - ygroup: language
        - nodeColor: server
31. ⬛ T9.31: Make all guis draggable
32. ✅ T9.32: Create properties gui
    1. ✅ T9.32.1: Create a new draggable gui, not nested inside any others
    2. ✅ T9.32.2: Create a single grid column layout
        1. ✅ T9.32.2.1: First row is the name of the first property type on the node
        2. ✅ T9.32.2.2: Rows below that are names of each possible value for that property
        3. ✅ T9.32.2.3: Example format:
            ```
            component
            core

            api
            ```      
      2. ✅ make the panel stretch to fit the entire height of the screen
    3. ✅ expand it into a 2d grid where the top row shows all the properties and beneath each property is a list of the various options for that property
    4. ✅ make each of the options a toggle.
      1. ✅ when the toggle is clicked, it becomes greyed and components with that property are filtered out of the data
      2. ✅ when I click a toggle the graph should be recreated with the newly filtered data                 
5. ✅ make the chart collapsible, and twice as wide.  reduce the font size by 10%
