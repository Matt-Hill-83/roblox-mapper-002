## Completed Tasks (Latest)

- ✅ Set CanCollide to false on Y planes
- ✅ Make Y shadow material concrete (not ForceField)

## T9: Additional Implementation Tasks

1. ✅ T9.1: Change space between y levels to 5 (already set to 5 in RENDERER_CONSTANTS.POSITIONING.LEVEL_SPACING)
2. ✅ T9.2: Figure out why links are not working (fixed - node UUID mismatch with harness_file_ vs harness_node_)
3. ✅ T9.3: Clean unused items from GUI
   1. ✅ T9.3.1: Remove num node types
   2. ✅ T9.3.2: Remove num link types
   3. ✅ T9.3.3: Remove num pet types
4. ✅ T9.4: Wrap all Y shadows in a Model (completed - YParallelShadows model)
5. ✅ T9.5: In the dropdowns for the axis properties, put the number of types of that property like this: service [15]
19. ✅ T9.19: Change y shadow label font color to black
6. ⬛ T9.6: Refactor dropdowns into grid
7. ✅ T9.7: Nix duplicate walls
8. ✅ T9.8: Push Y shadows to edge
   1. ✅ T9.8.1: Y shadows are in the way. reduce their size so that they start from the vertical wall and extend 10 units away from the wall
   2. ✅ T9.8.2: Set yshadow height in the y direction to 5
   3. ✅ T9.8.3: Set spacing between y shadow blocks to 2

21. ✅ T9.21: Link colors
12. ✅ T9.12: Are we using real links, or fake data?
23. ✅ Create a duplicate yshadows stack
  1. ✅ Position it similarly, so that it is aligned with the other vertical wall and protrudes 1 unit into the node area

9. ⬛ T9.9: Create a table of buttons for selecting
10. ⬛ T9.10: Stacks and Y axis
11. ⬛ T9.11: Pass in default axis options from game.service
13. ⬛ T9.13: Create GUI manager

14. ⬛ T9.14: Remove path property from data set
15. ⬛ T9.15: Remove yellow labels on xparallel shadow blocks
16. ⬛ T9.16: Create an algo to map ascendency
17. ⬛ T9.17: Fix node popup gui
18. ⬛ T9.18: Create duplicate y shadow stack
20. ⬛ T9.20: Add treeLevel as a property
22. ⬛ T9.22: Data summary gui with num nodes, links





24. remove the layer table from the configgui

25. ✅ create a new property named treeLevel and add it to the data.
   1. ✅ collect a Set of all unique link types and print them to the console, along with number of each found.
   2. ✅ we will use this information to assign parent-child directionality to the links.
   3. ✅ when the data is connected with its links, create an algo that will assign a node with no parent the treeLevel = 0.  It's first child will have a value of 1.  If a node has multiple parents, its treeValue is the highest of the treeValues it inherits.  We want to be able to use this value to sort the nodes in the y direction

26. create a table of link types that can be toggled, and the data will recalculate

27. ✅ create a read only gui that shows every unique link type and the count of how many times it appeared

28. button to toggle which lanes are higher

29. ✅ add a function to filter the links object and only keep records that have Import as the type

30. gui or all props and which to ignore

31. in game.ts pass in this object, which will set the initial values for the gui

{
xgroup: component,
zgroup: server,
ygroup: language,
nodeColor: server,

}
