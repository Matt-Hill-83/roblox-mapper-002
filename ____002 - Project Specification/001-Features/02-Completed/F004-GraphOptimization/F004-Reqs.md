# Feature 004: Graph Layout Optimization Requirements

## R56: Graph Layout Optimization

1. ✅ [GPT] Implement barycentric crossing minimization algorithm for hierarchical node positioning
2. ✅ [GPT] Add intelligent node spacing with 120px gaps between levels
3. ✅ [GPT] Integrate parent-position-based sorting to reduce edge crossings in React Flow graphs

## R57: React Flow Connector Styles

1. ✅ [GPT] Connectors shall be twice as thick
2. ✅ [GPT] Connectors shall be solid lines, not dashed

## R58: Horizontal Type-Based Node Positioning

1. ✅ [GPT] Nodes shall be positioned horizontally based on their entity type
2. ✅ [GPT] Each entity type shall occupy a distinct horizontal lane/zone with defined X-coordinate ranges
3. ✅ [GPT] Node positioning shall maintain hierarchical relationships within each type zone
4. ✅ [GPT] Cross-type connections shall be visually clear despite horizontal separation
5. ✅ [GPT] Type zones shall be evenly distributed across the available horizontal space
