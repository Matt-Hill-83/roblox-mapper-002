# Dev2 Task List - Code Review Implementation

## Overview

This task list is derived from the code review recommendations assigned to Dev2. Focus areas: input validation, type safety improvements, and code cleanup.

## Completed Tasks

### T2: Refactor UnifiedDataRenderer (Medium Priority) ✅

1. ✅ T4: Create module structure
   - Created unifiedDataRenderer folder with proper organization
   - Set up index.ts, interfaces.ts, constants.ts
   - Created core/ and rendering/ subdirectories

2. ✅ T5-T9: Extract and refactor components
   - Extracted DataGenerator, PositionCalculator, NodeRenderer, and UpdateManager classes
   - Created proper interfaces and type definitions
   - Successfully integrated all refactored modules

### T4: Implement Rendering Optimizations (Medium Priority) ✅

1. ✅ T14: Disable shadows on graph parts
   - Added CastShadow = false to all part creation locations
   - Verified no visual quality loss

2. ✅ T15: Optimize materials
   - Replaced all materials with SmoothPlastic
   - Changed from Concrete and Neon materials for better performance

3. ✅ T16: Optimize transparency
   - Verified most parts use Transparency = 0
   - Kept necessary transparency for invisible anchor parts

### Code Cleanup (Low Priority) ✅

1. ✅ T12: Document entry point orphans
   - Added comprehensive comments to main.client.ts and main.server.ts
   - Created README in controllers folder
   - Documented architectural decisions

2. ✅ T13: Create \_orphaned folder structure
   - Created client/controllers/\_orphaned folder
   - Moved colorPicker.controller.ts (standalone utility)
   - Documented folder purpose and reactivation process

## Remaining Tasks

### Type Safety Improvements (Medium Priority)

1. ⬛ T6: Create generic base classes
   1. ⬛ Design generic service base class
   2. ⬛ Design generic maker base class
   3. ⬛ Implement type parameters
   4. ⬛ Update existing classes to extend bases

2. ⬛ T7: Add type parameters to collections
   1. ⬛ Audit all Map and Set usage
   2. ⬛ Add proper type parameters

3. ⬛ T8: Improve type inference
   1. ⬛ Remove unnecessary type annotations
   2. ⬛ Let TypeScript infer where possible
   3. ⬛ Document inference patterns

### Enhanced Input Validation (High Priority)

1. ⬛ T1: Add string length validation
   1. ⬛ Implement validateNodeName() with 50 char limit
   2. ⬛ Add validation to all string inputs
   3. ⬛ Create comprehensive string validation utils

2. ⬛ T3: Add injection attack prevention
   1. ⬛ Create pattern matcher for malicious inputs
   2. ⬛ Block special characters (<>"'&)
   3. ⬛ Implement sanitization functions
   4. ⬛ Test with known injection patterns

## Summary
