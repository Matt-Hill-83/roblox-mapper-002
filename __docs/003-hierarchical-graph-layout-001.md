# Hierarchical Graph Layout Specification

## Summary

Create a 3D spatial layout system in Roblox that organizes entities geometrically to reflect their hierarchical connections. The system will use existing visual components (hexes, hex stacks, and ropes) to create an intuitive graph visualization where the physical positioning of entities represents their logical relationships. Parent entities will be positioned above their children, and related entity types will be clustered together to provide clear visual groupings of the hierarchical structure.

## Requirements

1. ✅ Spatial Layout Requirements

   1. ✅ R1: The system shall position parent entities above their children in 3D space
   2. ✅ R2: The system shall cluster related entity types in close proximity
   3. ✅ R3: The system shall maintain visual separation between different hierarchy trees
   4. ✅ R4: The system shall exclude orphaned entities from the initial layout

2. ✅ Visual Component Integration

   1. ✅ R5: The system shall use existing hex stack components for entity representation
   2. ✅ R6: The system shall use existing rope components for relationship visualization
   3. ✅ R7: The system shall maintain existing label rendering on relationship ropes
   4. ✅ R8: The system shall preserve existing color coding and visual properties

3. ✅ Layout Algorithm Requirements
   1. ✅ R9: The system shall calculate positions based on hierarchy analysis results
   2. ✅ R10: The system shall scale layout dimensions based on tree size and depth
   3. ✅ R11: The system shall prevent entity overlap through collision detection
   4. ✅ R12: The system shall center each hierarchy tree around its root entity
