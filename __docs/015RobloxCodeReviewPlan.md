# Roblox Code Review Plan

## Summary

A comprehensive plan to review the entire Roblox TypeScript codebase for quality, organization, and adherence to best practices. The review will cover architecture, code style, performance, security, and maintainability across all modules, services, and interfaces.

## Core Principles

1. ⬛ Systematic review of all code paths
