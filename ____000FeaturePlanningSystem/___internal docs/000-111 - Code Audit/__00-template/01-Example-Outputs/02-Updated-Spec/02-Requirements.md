# Code Quality Audit - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Type Safety Enhancement
- Add explicit type annotations to all function parameters and return types
- Define interfaces for all object structures
- Remove implicit 'any' types throughout the codebase
- Target: Reduce type annotation issues from 1,094 to 0

### FR2: Code Deduplication
- Identify and refactor the 66 duplicate code patterns
- Create shared utilities for common operations
- Implement DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Target: Reduce duplicate patterns by 80%

### FR3: Module Cohesion Improvement
- Restructure server modules to improve cohesion score
- Group related functionality together
- Separate concerns more clearly
- Target: Increase average cohesion from 0.78 to 0.85+

### FR4: Data File Management
- Extract large data files to external storage or database
- Implement lazy loading for data resources
- Reduce repository size and improve load times
- Target: Move 18,000+ lines of data out of TypeScript files

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Maintainability
- Code should be easy to understand and modify
- All functions should have clear, single responsibilities
- Complex logic should be well-documented

### NFR2: Performance
- Build times should not increase significantly
- Runtime performance should remain stable or improve
- Memory usage should be optimized

### NFR3: Developer Experience
- Type safety should improve IDE autocomplete
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- Development workflow should remain smooth

### NFR4: Testing
- All refactored code should maintain existing test coverage
- New utilities should include unit tests
- Integration tests should pass without modification

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: TypeScript Configuration
- Enable stricter TypeScript compiler options
- Set "noImplicitAny": true
- Set "strictNullChecks": true
- Maintain compatibility with roblox-ts

### TR2: Code Organization
- Follow existing folder structure conventions
- Maintain clear separation between client/server/shared
- Use barrel exports (index.ts) consistently

### TR3: Naming Conventions
- Fix the 12 identified naming convention violations
- Follow consistent camelCase for variables/functions
- Use PascalCase for types/interfaces/classes

### TR4: Documentation
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Document complex algorithms and business logic
- Update README with new patterns/utilities
