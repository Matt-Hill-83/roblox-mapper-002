# Flat Block Under Nodes Requirements

1. ⬛ R1: Block must be centered at the origin defined in game.env
2. ⬛ R2: Block height must be 5 units
3. ⬛ R3: Block material must be Concrete
4. ⬛ R4: Block color must be light blue
5. ⬛ R5: Block must be anchored (not affected by physics)
6. ⬛ R6: Block creation must be integrated into existing node creation process
7. ⬛ R7: Block should be positioned below all nodes in the tree

## Risks

- Risk 1: Origin coordinates in game.env might not be in expected format - Parse carefully with fallback to default
- Risk 2: Block might interfere with existing node interactions - Ensure CanCollide is false

## Decision Points

- Decision 1: Use Part instance for simplicity over MeshPart
- Decision 2: Fixed height of 5 units as specified rather than dynamic sizing
- Decision 3: Create block as sibling to GraphMaker folder for clear organization
