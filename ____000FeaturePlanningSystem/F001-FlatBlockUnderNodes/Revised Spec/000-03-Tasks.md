# Flat Block Under Nodes Task List

1. ✅ T1: Locate game.env and identify origin definition

   1. ✅ T1.1: Find game.env file location (found ORIGIN in game.service.ts)
   2. ✅ T1.2: Extract origin coordinates (x: 0, y: 0, z: 0)

2. ✅ T2: Create flat block creation function

   1. ✅ T2.1: Create new module for flat block creation (flatBlockCreator.ts)
   2. ✅ T2.2: Define block properties (size, material, color)
   3. ✅ T2.3: Implement anchoring property
   4. ✅ T2.4: Position block at origin with appropriate offset

3. ✅ T3: Integrate with node creation process

   1. ✅ T3.1: Locate main node creation entry point (UnifiedDataRenderer)
   2. ✅ T3.2: Add flat block creation call
   3. ✅ T3.3: Ensure block is created before nodes

4. ✅ T4: Calculate appropriate block dimensions

   1. ✅ T4.1: Determine node tree bounds (calculateBlockDimensions function)
   2. ✅ T4.2: Size block to extend beyond tree bounds (default 200x200)
