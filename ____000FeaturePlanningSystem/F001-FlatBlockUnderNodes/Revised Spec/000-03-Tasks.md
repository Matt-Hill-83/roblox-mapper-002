# Flat Block Under Nodes Task List

## Block Naming Convention
- **Platform Block** - The base green concrete block (100x100)
- **Group Shadow Block** (formerly "Shadow Block") - The light blue block with buffer
- **Swimlane Shadow Blocks** (formerly "Swimlane Blocks") - The semi-transparent colored blocks for each type

   1. ✅ T3.1: Locate main node creation entry point (UnifiedDataRenderer)
   2. ✅ T3.2: Add flat block creation call
   3. ✅ T3.3: Ensure block is created before nodes

4. ✅ T4: Calculate appropriate block dimensions

   1. ✅ T4.1: Determine node tree bounds (calculateBlockDimensions function)
   2. ✅ T4.2: Size block to extend beyond tree bounds (default 200x200)
   3. ✅ T4.3: Position block below lowest node (Y offset by height/2)

5. ✅ T5: Fix block dimensions and properties
   1. ✅ T5.1: Make block dimensions match node tree bounds
   2. ✅ T5.2: Make block solid (enable collision)
   3. ✅ T5.3: Set block height to 3 units in Y dimension
   4. ✅ T5.4: Delete existing block when regenerate is clicked

## New Tasks - Platform Block Implementation

6. ✅ T6: Create platform block

   1. ✅ T6.1: Create a new platform block in addition to the group shadow block
   2. ✅ T6.2: Set platform block color to light green
   3. ✅ T6.3: Make platform block the parent of the group shadow block

7. ✅ T7: Position platform block coincident with group shadow block

   1. ✅ T7.1: Position platform block at the same location as group shadow block
   2. ✅ T7.2: Set platform block Y dimension to (group shadow block height - 0.1) units
   3. ✅ T7.3: Ensure proper Z-fighting prevention with 0.1 unit difference

8. ✅ T8: Update block hierarchy

   1. ✅ T8.1: Modify creation order: create platform block first, then group shadow block
   2. ✅ T8.2: Set group shadow block's parent to be the platform block
   3. ✅ T8.3: Ensure both blocks are deleted on regenerate

9. ✅ T9: Additional fixes

   1. ✅ T9.1: Set platform x,z size to fixed 100x100 units

10. ✅ T10: Create platform block system

   1. ✅ T10.1: Create platform block with same Y dimension as group shadow block
   2. ✅ T10.2: Position platform block 0.1 units lower than group shadow block
   3. ✅ T10.3: Set platform block material to Concrete
   4. ✅ T10.4: Set platform block color to light green

11. ✅ T11: Enhance group shadow block with buffer

   1. ✅ T11.1: Add 1 block buffer to group shadow block dimensions
   2. ✅ T11.2: Parent group shadow block to platform block

12. ✅ T12: Create swimlane shadow blocks

   1. ✅ T12.1: Create individual swimlane shadow blocks under each swimlane
   2. ✅ T12.2: Match swimlane shadow block dimensions to swimlane size
   3. ✅ T12.3: Match swimlane shadow block color to swimlane color
   4. ✅ T12.4: Parent swimlane shadow blocks to group shadow block

13. ✅ T13: Swimlane shadow block positioning improvements

   1. ✅ T13.1: Create zFightingFix constant (0.1) in FLAT_BLOCK_DEFAULTS
   2. ✅ T13.2: Position swimlane shadow blocks 0.1 units higher than group shadow block using zFightingFix
   3. ✅ T13.3: Make swimlane shadow blocks as wide as group shadow block without buffer

14. ⬜ T14: Rename blocks for clarity

   1. ⬜ T14.1: Rename ShadowBlock to GroupShadowBlock in code
   2. ⬜ T14.2: Rename SwimLaneBlock to SwimlaneShadowBlock in code
