# Flat Block Under Nodes Task List

## Completed Tasks

1. ✅ T1: Locate game.env and identify origin definition

   1. ✅ T1.1: Find game.env file location (found ORIGIN in game.service.ts)
   2. ✅ T1.2: Extract origin coordinates (x: 0, y: 0, z: 0)

2. ✅ T2: Create flat block creation function

   1. ✅ T2.1: Create new module for flat block creation (flatBlockCreator.ts)
   2. ✅ T2.2: Define block properties (size, material, color)
   3. ✅ T2.3: Implement anchoring property
   4. ✅ T2.4: Position block at origin with appropriate offset

3. ✅ T3: Integrate with node creation process

   1. ✅ T3.1: Locate main node creation entry point (UnifiedDataRenderer)
   2. ✅ T3.2: Add flat block creation call
   3. ✅ T3.3: Ensure block is created before nodes

4. ✅ T4: Calculate appropriate block dimensions

   1. ✅ T4.1: Determine node tree bounds (calculateBlockDimensions function)
   2. ✅ T4.2: Size block to extend beyond tree bounds (default 200x200)
   3. ✅ T4.3: Position block below lowest node (Y offset by height/2)

5. ✅ T5: Fix block dimensions and properties
   1. ✅ T5.1: Make block dimensions match node tree bounds
   2. ✅ T5.2: Make block solid (enable collision)
   3. ✅ T5.3: Set block height to 3 units in Y dimension
   4. ✅ T5.4: Delete existing block when regenerate is clicked

## New Tasks - Platform Block Implementation

6. ✅ T6: Create platform block

   1. ✅ T6.1: Create a new platform block in addition to the shadow block
   2. ✅ T6.2: Set platform block color to light green
   3. ✅ T6.3: Make platform block the parent of the shadow block

7. ✅ T7: Position platform block coincident with shadow block

   1. ✅ T7.1: Position platform block at the same location as shadow block
   2. ✅ T7.2: Set platform block Y dimension to (shadow block height - 0.1) units
   3. ✅ T7.3: Ensure proper Z-fighting prevention with 0.1 unit difference

8. ✅ T8: Update block hierarchy

   1. ✅ T8.1: Modify creation order: create platform block first, then shadow block
   2. ✅ T8.2: Set shadow block's parent to be the platform block
   3. ✅ T8.3: Ensure both blocks are deleted on regenerate

9. ✅ T9: Additional fixes

   1. ✅ T9.1: Set platform x,z size to fixed 100x100 units
