# F006 - ReDesign Layout Construction Tasks

1. ⬛ T1: Refactor X-parallel lane creation
   1. ⬛ T1.1: Calculate total length needed for all nodes in X direction
   2. ⬛ T1.2: Create X-parallel lanes with fixed cross-sectional dimensions
   3. ⬛ T1.3: Remove dependency on cluster bounds for lane width

2. ⬛ T2: Refactor Z-parallel lane creation  
   1. ⬛ T2.1: Define constant for standard Z-parallel lane width
   2. ⬛ T2.2: Define constant for inter-lane spacing
   3. ⬛ T2.3: Calculate lane positions based on fixed width + spacing
   4. ⬛ T2.4: Fit node content within fixed lane width

3. ⬛ T3: Refactor group shadow creation
   1. ⬛ T3.1: Calculate shadow dimensions after all lanes are created
   2. ⬛ T3.2: Size shadow to encompass all lanes with appropriate padding
   3. ⬛ T3.3: Update rendering order to create shadow last

4. ⬛ T4: Update buffer system
   1. ⬛ T4.1: Convert SHADOW_BUFFER to represent fixed buffer width
   2. ⬛ T4.2: Ensure buffers add to lane dimensions, not content dimensions
   3. ⬛ T4.3: Create clear separation between content area and buffer area

## Diagnostic Tasks for Layout Issues

5. ⬛ T5: Diagnose X-parallel lane width calculation
   1. ⬛ T5.1: Trace how X-parallel lane bounds are calculated
   2. ⬛ T5.2: Verify node positions are correctly passed to lane calculation
   3. ⬛ T5.3: Check if lane width is using shadow dimensions instead of content
   4. ⬛ T5.4: Log actual vs expected bounds at each calculation step

6. ⬛ T6: Diagnose Z-parallel lane positioning
   1. ⬛ T6.1: Verify the starting X position calculation for lanes
   2. ⬛ T6.2: Check if lanes are being centered correctly
   3. ⬛ T6.3: Trace the relationship between lane positions and shadow center
   4. ⬛ T6.4: Verify total width calculation matches actual lane layout

7. ⬛ T7: Fix color duplication between lane types
   1. ⬛ T7.1: Identify where X-parallel lanes get their colors
   2. ⬛ T7.2: Identify where Z-parallel lanes get their colors
   3. ⬛ T7.3: Create separate color arrays for each lane type
   4. ⬛ T7.4: Ensure visual distinction between lane types

8. ⬛ T8: Verify content-to-lane alignment
   1. ⬛ T8.1: Check node Z positions match X-parallel lane positions
   2. ⬛ T8.2: Check node X positions match Z-parallel lane positions
   3. ⬛ T8.3: Log misalignments between nodes and their lanes
   4. ⬛ T8.4: Trace coordinate transformations through the pipeline


## New Issues from Visual Inspection

9. ⬛ T9: Fix node positioning within lanes
   1. ⬛ T9.1: Nodes not centered within Z-parallel lanes - they use original positions
   2. ⬛ T9.2: Implement node repositioning to center within assigned lanes
   3. ⬛ T9.3: Update node X coordinates to match Z-parallel lane centers
   4. ⬛ T9.4: Ensure consistent node spacing within each lane

10. ⬛ T10: Fix X-parallel lane alignment
    1. ⬛ T10.1: X-parallel lanes misaligned with actual node Z positions
    2. ⬛ T10.2: Calculate X-parallel lane positions based on actual node groups
    3. ⬛ T10.3: Ensure X-parallel lanes encompass their node groups properly
    4. ⬛ T10.4: Fix Z-position calculations for X-parallel lanes

11. ⬛ T11: Fix visual polish issues
    
    
    3. ⬛ T11.3: Some nodes too close to lane edges despite width increase
    4. ⬛ T11.4: Consider lane width based on actual content needs

12. ⬛ T12: Address node-to-lane assignment
    1. ⬛ T12.1: Verify nodes are assigned to correct lanes
    2. ⬛ T12.2: Update node positions after lane creation
    3. ⬛ T12.3: Ensure nodes respect lane boundaries
    4. ⬛ T12.4: Handle edge cases where content exceeds lane capacity
