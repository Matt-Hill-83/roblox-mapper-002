# Color System Review - Tasks

## Task List

### 1. ✅ T1: Color Discovery and Inventory

1. ✅ T1.1: Search for all Color3 instantiations in the codebase
   - Use grep/search tools to find "new Color3(" patterns
   - Document each instance with file location and context
   - Note RGB values and any associated comments

2. ✅ T1.2: Identify color constant files and modules
   - Locate files like robloxColors.ts, blockConstants.ts
   - Document exported color constants and arrays
   - Map import relationships between files

3. ✅ T1.3: Find inline color definitions
   - Search for Color3 definitions not in constant files
   - Document context and usage of inline colors
   - Note any hardcoded RGB values

4. ✅ T1.4: Document color import/export patterns
   - Map how colors flow through the module system
   - Identify central color sources vs scattered definitions
   - Document any circular dependencies

### 2. ✅ T2: Color Usage Analysis

1. ✅ T2.1: Map colors to their component usage
   - Node colors (person types, animals, etc.)
   - Swimlane/shadow colors (X-axis, Z-axis)
   - UI element colors
   - Label and text colors

2. ✅ T2.2: Identify color assignment patterns
   - Sequential assignment (arrays with indices)
   - Direct mapping (object key-value pairs)
   - Conditional assignment (based on properties)
   - Dynamic generation patterns

3. ✅ T2.3: Analyze color inheritance and propagation
   - How colors pass from data to visual components
   - Color transformation or modification patterns
   - Default color fallback mechanisms

4. ✅ T2.4: Document visual property mapping systems
   - Visual mapping configuration (backgroundColor, borderColor)
   - Property-to-color mapping logic
   - User-configurable color options

### 3. ✅ T3: Create Color Documentation

1. ✅ T3.1: Generate comprehensive color usage table
   - Create markdown table with columns:
     - Color Name/ID
     - RGB Values
     - Hex Equivalent
     - Primary Usage
     - File Location
     - Notes

2. ✅ T3.2: Create color relationship diagrams
   - Mermaid diagram showing color module dependencies
   - Visual hierarchy of color categories
   - Component-to-color mapping flowchart

3. ✅ T3.3: Document color naming conventions
   - Current naming patterns
   - Inconsistencies in naming
   - Semantic vs descriptive names

4. ✅ T3.4: Map colors to their visual output
   - Screenshot examples where applicable
   - Color swatch visualization
   - Usage context examples

### 4. ✅ T4: Generate Analysis Report

1. ✅ T4.1: Write executive summary
   - High-level findings
   - Key issues identified
   - Impact on maintainability

2. ✅ T4.2: Create detailed findings section
   - Comprehensive analysis results
   - Specific examples of issues
   - Quantitative metrics (number of colors, duplicates, etc.)

3. ✅ T4.3: Develop improvement recommendations
   - Short-term fixes
   - Long-term architectural improvements
   - Best practices adoption

4. ✅ T4.4: Propose color system architecture
   - Centralized color management system
   - Theme support structure
   - Color accessibility considerations
   - Migration strategy from current state

## Execution Order

Tasks should be executed in the order listed above, as each task builds upon the findings of the previous ones. The discovery phase (T1) provides the raw data, the analysis phase (T2) interprets the data, the documentation phase (T3) organizes the findings, and the report phase (T4) synthesizes everything into actionable recommendations.
