# T23: Vertical Wall Feature Investigation

## Summary
Investigation of the vertical wall feature implementation and its integration with Y-axis property visualization.

## Findings

### 1. Vertical Wall Creator Module (`verticalWallCreator.ts`)
- **Location**: `/src/shared/modules/renderers/verticalWallCreator.ts`
- **Purpose**: Creates vertical glass walls around the platform for Y-axis property visualization
- **Key Functions**:
  - `createVerticalWalls()`: Creates 4 transparent glass walls (front, back, left, right) around platform bounds
  - `createWallSwimlanes()`: Creates swimlane shadows on the vertical walls based on Y-axis property groups

### 2. Wall Implementation Details
- **Material**: Glass with 0.7 transparency
- **Color**: Gray (0.3, 0.3, 0.3)
- **Thickness**: 0.5 units
- **Features**:
  - Walls extend to specified height
  - No collision (CanCollide = false)
  - Anchored in place
  - Creates shadows on walls for property groups with labels

### 3. Y-Axis GUI Controls (`yAxisControls.ts`)
- **Location**: `/src/client/services/configGui/components/yAxisControls.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Toggle checkbox for "Use Layer" (traditional layer hierarchy)
  - Dropdown for Y-axis property selection (when not using layer)
  - Available properties: type, petType, petColor, age, firstName, lastName, countryOfBirth, countryOfResidence
  - Dynamic UI that shows/hides property dropdown based on toggle state

### 4. Integration Status
- **Vertical walls are imported** in `unifiedDataRenderer.ts` (line 20)
- **Y-axis controls exist** in the GUI and are functional
- **Y-axis configuration is stored** in the enhanced config (yAxisConfig)
- **However**: The vertical walls are NOT currently being created or used in the renderer

### 5. Missing Integration Points
The following integration is needed to complete the Y-axis feature:
1. Check for Y-axis configuration in the renderer
2. Calculate Y positions based on selected property or layer
3. Create vertical walls when Y-axis is enabled
4. Generate wall swimlanes for Y-axis property groups
5. Position nodes at appropriate Y heights

## Current State
- ✅ Vertical wall creation code exists and is complete
- ✅ Y-axis GUI controls are implemented and functional
- ✅ Y-axis configuration is stored in state
- ❌ Vertical walls are not created in the renderer
- ❌ Y-axis positioning is not implemented
- ❌ Wall swimlanes are not generated

## Next Steps for T14 Implementation
To complete the Y-axis toggle feature (T14), the following tasks are needed:

1. **T14.1**: Add Y-axis toggle control to GUI ✅ (Already exists)
2. **T14.2**: Create vertical wall geometry around platform (Code exists, needs integration)
3. **T14.3**: Implement property-based Y positioning (Not implemented)
4. **T14.4**: Add swimlane shadows on vertical walls (Code exists, needs integration)
5. **T14.5**: Update position calculator for Y-axis modes (Not implemented)

## Code References
- Vertical wall creator: `src/shared/modules/renderers/verticalWallCreator.ts`
- Y-axis GUI controls: `src/client/services/configGui/components/yAxisControls.ts`
- Main renderer: `src/shared/modules/renderers/unifiedDataRenderer/unifiedDataRenderer.ts`
- Position calculator: `src/shared/modules/renderers/unifiedDataRenderer/core/positionCalculator.ts`

## Conclusion
The vertical wall feature code exists but is not integrated into the rendering pipeline. The Y-axis GUI controls are functional but their configuration is not being used to affect node positioning or create vertical walls. This feature is partially implemented but requires integration work to be functional.
