# Pet Lanes Misalignment - FIXED

## Summary of Fix

The pet swimlane shadow blocks (Cat and Dog lanes) were not centered above the blue group shadow block. The issue was fixed by modifying the `shadowBlockCreator.ts` file to center the collection of pet lanes over the group shadow block.

## Changes Made

### File: `/src/shared/modules/renderers/blocks/shadowBlockCreator.ts`

1. **Modified `createZAxisShadowBlocks` method:**
   - Added calculation of collective bounds for all pet lanes
   - Calculated the center of the collective pet lanes
   - Computed offset needed to center pet lanes at Z=0 (group shadow center)
   - Passed offset to `createZAxisBlock` method

2. **Modified `createZAxisBlock` method:**
   - Added `offsetZ` parameter (default 0 for backward compatibility)
   - Applied offset to Z position when creating blocks
   - Updated debug output to show adjusted position

## Implementation Details

```typescript
// Calculate collective bounds
let collectiveMinZ = math.huge;
let collectiveMaxZ = -math.huge;

propertyBounds.forEach((bounds) => {
  collectiveMinZ = math.min(collectiveMinZ, bounds.minZ);
  collectiveMaxZ = math.max(collectiveMaxZ, bounds.maxZ);
});

// Calculate offset to center at Z=0
const collectiveCenter = (collectiveMinZ + collectiveMaxZ) / 2;
const offsetZ = 0 - collectiveCenter;

// Apply offset when creating blocks
const adjustedZPosition = dimensions.position.Z + offsetZ;
```

## Expected Result

After this fix:
- The collection of pet swimlane blocks will be centered above the group shadow block
- Both Cat and Dog lanes will be shifted forward by 2.5 units
- The visual hierarchy will be clearer with proper alignment
- New positions: Cat at Z=-2.5, Dog at Z=2.5 (centered around Z=0)
