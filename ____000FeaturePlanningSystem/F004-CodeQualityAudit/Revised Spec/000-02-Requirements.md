# Code Quality and Best Practices Audit - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. ⬛ R1: Analyze all TypeScript files in the src directory
2. ⬛ R2: Generate a comprehensive report with summary, table, diagrams, and recommendations
3. ⬛ R3: Identify code quality issues including:
   1. ⬛ R3.1: Duplicate code patterns
   2. ⬛ R3.2: Overly complex functions
   3. ⬛ R3.3: Inconsistent naming conventions
   4. ⬛ R3.4: Missing type annotations
   5. ⬛ R3.5: Unused variables and imports
4. ⬛ R4: Evaluate adherence to best practices:
   1. ⬛ R4.1: SOLID principles
   2. ⬛ R4.2: DRY principle
   3. ⬛ R4.3: Service architecture patterns
   4. ⬛ R4.4: Error handling patterns
5. ⬛ R5: Generate visual diagrams showing:
   1. ⬛ R5.1: Module dependencies
   2. ⬛ R5.2: Service relationships
   3. ⬛ R5.3: Code complexity hotspots
6. ⬛ R6: Provide actionable recommendations for improvements

## Technical Requirements

7. ⬛ R7: Analysis must be performed statically without executing code
8. ⬛ R8: Support TypeScript and Roblox-specific patterns
9. ⬛ R9: Generate report in Markdown format
10. ⬛ R10: Include mermaid diagrams for visualization

## Report Requirements

11. ⬛ R11: Executive summary with key metrics
12. ⬛ R12: Detailed file inventory with:
    1. ⬛ R12.1: File path and name
    2. ⬛ R12.2: Lines of code
    3. ⬛ R12.3: File size
    4. ⬛ R12.4: Number of issues found
    5. ⬛ R12.5: Complexity score
13. ⬛ R13: Prioritized recommendations:
    1. ⬛ R13.1: High priority (critical issues)
    2. ⬛ R13.2: Medium priority (important improvements)
    3. ⬛ R13.3: Low priority (nice-to-have enhancements)

## Risks

- Risk 1: Large codebase may require significant analysis time
- Risk 2: Complex TypeScript/Roblox patterns may be difficult to analyze automatically
- Risk 3: Some best practices may be subjective and context-dependent

## Decision Points

- Decision 1: Use static analysis approach rather than runtime analysis for safety
- Decision 2: Focus on TypeScript-specific patterns and Roblox framework conventions
- Decision 3: Prioritize actionable recommendations over theoretical improvements
