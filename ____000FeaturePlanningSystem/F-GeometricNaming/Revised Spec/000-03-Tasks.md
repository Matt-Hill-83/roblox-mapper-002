# Geometric Naming Audit and Revision - Tasks

1. ⬛ T1: Code Audit and Analysis
   1. ⬛ T1.1: Search for all occurrences of "X-axis" and "Z-axis" related naming
   2. ⬛ T1.2: Identify files using property-based naming (e.g., "type", "petType")
   3. ⬛ T1.3: Find all swimlane-related code and naming patterns
   4. ⬛ T1.4: Locate axis labeling and orientation references
   5. ⬛ T1.5: Document buffer and dimension naming conventions

2. ⬛ T2: Create Current State Documentation
   1. ⬛ T2.1: List all confusing naming patterns found
   2. ⬛ T2.2: Map file locations for each pattern
   3. ⬛ T2.3: Create data flow diagram showing current naming
   4. ⬛ T2.4: Document the actual geometric behavior vs named behavior

3. ⬛ T3: Design New Naming Convention
   1. ⬛ T3.1: Define axis-focused naming rules
   2. ⬛ T3.2: Create naming mapping table (old → new)
   3. ⬛ T3.3: Design consistent buffer/dimension naming
   4. ⬛ T3.4: Ensure clarity for swimlane orientation vs grouping

4. ⬛ T4: Create Implementation Plan
   1. ⬛ T4.1: Prioritize changes by impact and risk
   2. ⬛ T4.2: Group related changes into atomic commits
   3. ⬛ T4.3: Identify test points for validation
   4. ⬛ T4.4: Create rollback strategy
