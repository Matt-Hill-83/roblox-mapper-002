# Code Quality Audit 005 - Summary

## Overview

This audit evaluates the Roblox Mapper 002 project following the recent cleanup and modularization efforts:
- Removal of 51 unused exports across 12 files
- Deletion of unused tempTestData.ts file
- Refactoring of dataGenerator.ts from 647 lines to 121 lines with separate module files
- Modular architecture implementation with proper separation of concerns

## Objectives

1. Assess impact of dead code removal and modularization
2. Validate new module structure and dependencies
3. Create comprehensive file and class tables as specified
4. Generate updated architectural diagrams
5. Identify remaining improvement opportunities

## Scope

- All TypeScript files in the project
- Focus on recently modified modules and their dependencies
- Architecture and module dependency analysis
- Code quality metrics with comparison to previous audit
- Visual documentation of current architecture

## Expected Findings

- Improved maintainability from dead code removal
- Better module organization from dataGenerator refactoring
- Reduced file complexity and cleaner imports
- Enhanced separation of concerns
- Potential for further optimization opportunities

## New Requirements

Based on the updated instructions, this audit will include:
1. Detailed tables of files with lines, classes, methods count
2. Table of classes and their method counts
3. DrawIO architecture diagrams:
   - 00-Project-Architecture.drawio
   - 01-DataFlow.drawio
