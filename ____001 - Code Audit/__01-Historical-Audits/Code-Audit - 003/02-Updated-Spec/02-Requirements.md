# Code Quality Audit 003 - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Comprehensive File Analysis
- Scan all TypeScript files in src/, _webapp/src/, and scripts/
- Collect detailed metrics for each file:
  - File size and line count
  - Last modified date
  - Complexity metrics
  - Type annotation coverage
- Identify orphaned and dead code

### FR2: Type Safety Assessment
- Analyze current type annotation coverage
- Identify implicit 'any' usage
- Check for missing return types
- Validate interface definitions
- Compare improvements since last audit

### FR3: Architecture Analysis
- Map module dependencies across the codebase
- Detect circular dependencies
- Assess service pattern implementation
- Evaluate separation of concerns
- Analyze module cohesion scores

### FR4: Code Quality Metrics
- Measure cyclomatic complexity
- Identify code duplication patterns
- Check naming convention compliance
- Find unused exports and imports
- Analyze function and file sizes

### FR5: Performance Analysis
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Find large files that could impact build times
- Analyze bundle size implications
- Check for memory usage patterns

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Accuracy
- All metrics must be accurate and verifiable
- False positives should be minimized
- Analysis should cover 100% of specified files

### NFR2: Actionability
- Recommendations must be specific and implementable
- Issues should be prioritized by impact
- Each finding should include resolution steps

### NFR3: Comparability
- Results should be comparable with previous audits
- Progress metrics should be clearly shown
- Trend analysis should be included

### NFR4: Readability
- Reports should be clear and well-organized
- Technical details should be explained
- Visual aids should enhance understanding

## Technical Requirements

### TR1: Analysis Tools
- Use established code analysis tools from 02-Tools/
- Ensure compatibility with TypeScript and roblox-ts
- Support for both client and server code analysis

### TR2: Output Formats
- JSON data files for programmatic access
- Markdown reports for human readability
- DrawIO diagrams for visual representation

### TR3: Coverage Scope
- All TypeScript files (.ts)
- Configuration files (tsconfig.json, package.json)
- Roblox-specific files if applicable
- Exclude node_modules and build outputs

### TR4: Metrics Collection
- Lines of code (LOC)
- Cyclomatic complexity
- Type coverage percentage
- Dependency count
- Duplication percentage
- Cohesion and coupling scores

## Specific Analysis Requirements

### SAR1: Roblox-Specific Patterns
- Check for proper client/server separation
- Validate service architecture patterns
- Ensure proper use of shared modules

### SAR2: Web Application Analysis
- Analyze Next.js application structure
- Check React component patterns
- Validate TypeScript usage in web app

### SAR3: Data Management
- Identify large data files
- Check data loading patterns
- Analyze CSV to TypeScript conversion

### SAR4: Development Workflow
- Assess build process efficiency
- Check for development tool configuration
- Analyze script organization

## Success Metrics

- 100% file coverage within scope
- Zero false positives in critical findings
- Clear improvement trends vs previous audit
- Actionable recommendations for all issues
- Complete dependency mapping
- Accurate complexity measurements
