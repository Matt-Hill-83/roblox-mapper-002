|----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary:
DesignANewGeometricGraphLayout
We will design a new geometric layout upon which we will overlay graph data feature nodes and links.
The resulting structures will be rendered in roblox.

|----------------------------------------------------------------------
Requirements:

. GUIs
.. Data Generation Engine
... how many records to create
... how many unique values per property
... table showing 1 rows of generated data
.. Structure Layout Engine
... TBD 2. create a simple placeholder
.. Data Linking
... TBD
.. Settings GUI
... asdf
.. GUI tabbing system
... create a system where
.... gui names are listed in a compact format on the lhs of the screen
.... when you click a gui name, the previous one closes and the new one opens, with a title at the top
.... default GUI will be Data Generation Engine

. Services
.. Data Generation Engine
... Create random json data and write it to an object in a ts file so that it can be read at runtime.
.... Data Objects
.... Person (persons)
.... assign each a guid
.... properties (chosen randomly from 10 unique choices)
..... firstName
..... lastName
..... country
..... petType
..... countryLivesIn (Country)
..... countryBornIn (Country)
..... countryWorksIn (Country)
.... Country
.... name
.... isSunny
.... isWarm
.... happiness (1-10)
.... expensive (1-10)

. Structure Layout Engine
.. TBD
... Will generate geometric structure within which nodes will be positioned

. Code Structure
.. contain all code in new folders that do not overlay with existing codebase
... create a new folder structure with the name src2 for the root. This will later be moved into a clean repo
... tbd
.. look at existing codebase and use best practices
... create a folder system and file structure

. Sample Code
.. in order to validate the folder structure, have the existing game.service do this:
... call a function rubixCubeMaker
.... which calls cubeMaker
..... which calls blockMaker
...... make calls labelMaker

== Instructions for AI Agent

=== Note to AI Agent

. If Just do a Code Audit? === true, skip the rest of this doc and execute 000-111-CodeAuditPlan.md in the xxx folder.
.. "____000FeaturePlanningSystem/___internal docs/000-111 - Code Audit/Int-000-01-CodeQualityAudit"
.. place the results in a new folder. skip the rest of these instructions

. This file is a set of instructions that you will follow in order to help plan a feature.
. Following the instructions will create a final product that is a folder containing a set of documents that will be used one of more AI agents.
. Follow each Step.
.. After you complete the Step, ask the user the User Question provided for that task.
.. The user will possibly make some edits, and direct you to do the next Step.
.. Do not perform any Step unless told to.
.. When told to run this file, assume the Summary and Features above have been updated to reflect current needs.
.. Output
... A sample of the final output folder can be found here.
.... Sample Output:
.... ./F000-TicTacToe (example)
.. User Message
... Hyperlink all file and folder names when outputting the User Message
... Do not add your own extemporaneous commentary or fluff

|----------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Step 1 - Create Single Spec Document

==== Inputs
. Summary and Requirements provided above

==== Actions for AI Agent
. Read Inputs
. Use the "Spec Building Instructions" below to create output
. The outputs should be concise and without meaningless filler content

==== Outputs
. folder that follows the naming conventions in Sample Output
. files that follow this naming convention
.. 000-00a-TicTacToe-InitialSpec-001.md
.. 000-00b-TicTacToe-InitialSpec-001.drawio

==== User Question
. I have finished Step 1: <step name>
. I used these Inputs:
. <Inputs names>
. to create these Outputs:
. <output names>
. Make any changes, ask me to update it, and tell me when you are ready for
. Step 2 <step name>
. (or just type "Yes".)

|----------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Step 2 - Break Spec into Smaller Files

==== Inputs
. Output docs from Step 1. Example: "F000-00-TicTacToe-InitialSpec-001"

==== Actions for AI Agent
. Read the Inputs and Create the Outputs

==== Outputs
. Create a folder called: "Revised Spec"
. Divide the information in the Input doc into the following 3 docs and place them in the new folder
.. 000-01-Summary.md
... include ascii representation of gui here
.. 000--02-Requirements.md
.. 000-03-Tasks.md
. (The purpose is to isolate the tasks and make them easier to review and execute)
. The outputs should be concise and without meaningless filler content

==== User Question
. I have finished Step 2: <step name>
. I used these Inputs:
. <Inputs names>
. to create these Outputs:
. <output names>
. Make any changes, ask me to update it, and tell me when you are ready for
. Step 3 <step name> (yes)

|----------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Step 3 - Execution

==== Inputs
. Output docs from previous step.

==== Actions for AI Agent
. Read the Task List
. Execute the first task and its sub-tasks
. If a task fails or cannot be completed, stop and ask the user for next steps.
. When all subtasks are complete, mark them completed in the Task doc and ask the User Question

==== Outputs
. Any files created by doing the task

==== User Question
. I have finished Step 3: <step name>
. I completed these tasks:
. <task list>
. The following files were created:
. <files list>
. Shall I commit the changes?

|----------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Step 3 - Commit code

==== Inputs
. Files Changed by executing tasks

==== Actions for AI Agent
. Create a commit
.. Include Feature name and task number in title
.. Describe changes in body
.. Do not state that an AI Agent made the commit

==== Outputs
. none

==== User Question
. After each commit:
.. I have committed the changes for <task name>
.. Shall I execute <task name>?
. After final commit:
.. All tasks are committed. Shall I perform a Code Audit?

|----------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Step 4 - Code Audit

==== Inputs
. None

==== Actions for AI Agent
. After all tasks are completed and committed, create a doc titled
.. "F000-04-TicTacToe-CodeAudit-001.md", that contains the following sections
... Table of files involved in feature
.... file name
.... number of lines
.... is New
... mermaid diagram showing relationships between all files
... Quality Audit that identifies any areas where the code can be improved
... Code Improvement Task List

==== Outputs
. none

==== User Question
. I have committed the changes for <task name>
. Shall I execute <task name>? (yes)

== Spec Building Instructions

Use these outline conventions when creating the doc

      1. ⬛ Siamese

      3. ⬛ British Shorthair

2. ⬛ Cat Behavior

== Core Principles

. The design should:
.. Be as simple as possible
.. Include only the features necessary to prove the concept
.. No mock data
.. Minimal error handling
.. No tests

== Required Elements

Organize the doc into these sections, in this order:

. Summary
. Requirements
.. Each should have a unique number (R1, R2, etc.)
.. Include References section if needed
. Task List. Each task described with:
.. Line item
.. Unique number
.. Unchecked checkbox icon
.. read this doc and follow the conventions: 001-outline-conventions.md
. List of risks (if any)
. List of decision points (if any)
. ASCII representation of GUI
. Text based file/function tree
. A mermaid flowchart

== Example Format

=== Feature Name Specification

==== Requirements

. ⬛ Requirements
.. ⬛ The feature should accomplish X
.. ⬛ The feature should integrate with Y
.. ⬛ The feature should respond within Z milliseconds

==== Risks

* Risk 1: Description of potential risk and mitigation strategy
* Risk 2: Description of another potential risk

==== Decision Points

* Decision 1: Choice made between X and Y approaches because of Z
* Decision 2: Selected technology A over B because of C requirements

==== ASCII representation of GUI

==== File and Function Structure (ascii)
