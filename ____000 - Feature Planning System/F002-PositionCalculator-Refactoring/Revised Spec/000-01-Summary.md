# Position Calculator Refactoring - Summary

## Overview

Refactor the positionCalculator.ts module (350 lines) to improve code organization, maintainability, and separation of concerns. The module currently handles swim lane positioning, origin centering, and property-based positioning logic in a single class. This refactoring will break down the monolithic class into smaller, focused modules while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Key Objectives

1. Separate concerns into focused modules
2. Maintain all existing functionality
3. Improve code readability and maintainability
4. Reduce method complexity
5. Keep backward compatibility

## Module Architecture

The refactored architecture will consist of:

- **PositionCalculator** (Main orchestrator)
- **BoundsCalculator** (Handles cluster boundary calculations)
- **NodeOrganizer** (Organizes nodes by properties and layers)
- **PositionMapper** (Creates property-based position mappings)
- **SwimLaneCalculator** (Calculates swim lane positions)

All modules will be implemented as internal classes within the main file to avoid Roblox module loading issues.
