# Position Calculator Refactoring - Requirements

## Functional Requirements

1. ⬛ R1: Maintain all existing public API methods and signatures
   - `getClusterBounds(cluster: Cluster): BoundsResult`
   - `centerBottomAtOrigin(cluster: Cluster, origin: Vector3, config?: EnhancedGeneratorConfig): void`
   - `calculateLayerSwimLanePositions(cluster: Cluster, config: EnhancedGeneratorConfig): void`

2. ⬛ R2: Preserve swim lane positioning algorithm behavior
   - Nodes grouped by X-axis property into vertical columns
   - Nodes distributed by layer (Y-axis) or Y-axis property
   - Z-axis positioning based on Z-axis property

3. ⬛ R3: Keep origin centering functionality intact
   - Center bottom of cluster at specified origin
   - Apply Y offset if configured
   - Ensure minimum ground clearance

4. ⬛ R4: Maintain property-based positioning for X, Y, and Z axes
   - Support dynamic property selection
   - Use default properties when not specified
   - Handle property value resolution

## Non-Functional Requirements

5. ⬛ R5: Ensure backward compatibility with current consumers
   - No changes to public method signatures
   - Same behavior for all configurations

6. ⬛ R6: Improve code organization and separation of concerns
   - Each module handles single responsibility
   - Clear interfaces between modules
   - Reduced coupling

7. ⬛ R7: Reduce complexity of individual methods
   - Break down large methods into smaller ones
   - Improve readability
   - Easier to understand and maintain

8. ⬛ R8: Create focused modules with single responsibilities
   - BoundsCalculator: Boundary calculations only
   - NodeOrganizer: Node organization and sorting
   - PositionMapper: Property to position mapping
   - SwimLaneCalculator: Position assignment

## Technical Requirements

9. ⬛ R9: Use internal classes to avoid Roblox module loading issues
10. ⬛ R10: Maintain TypeScript/roblox-ts compatibility
11. ⬛ R11: Preserve existing error handling behavior
12. ⬛ R12: Keep performance characteristics similar or better
