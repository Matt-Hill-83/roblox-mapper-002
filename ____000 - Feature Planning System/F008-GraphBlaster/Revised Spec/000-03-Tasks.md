11. ✅ T7.11: have layout call this method before passing an origin in to rcm.
   1. ✅ layout should pass in an origin so that the bottom of the rubix cube is 1 unit above the top of the layout baseplate 

## T8: ✅ Shadow Grid

1. ✅ T8.1: Add method to RubixCubeService called createShadowGrid
2. ✅ T8.2: Create shadow blocks using the cube data:
   - **Quantity**: One shadow block per Z-row (n blocks where n = numBlocks.z)
   - **Orientation**: Shadow blocks run parallel to X-axis
   - **Example**: For RC with x=3, z=5, create 5 shadow lanes
3. ✅ T8.3: Position and size shadow blocks:
   - **Y Position**: 5 units beneath rubix cube bottom
   - **Height**: 1 unit tall (Y dimension)
   - **Width (Z)**: Same as block Z dimension
   - **Length (X)**: Total X span of blocks including gaps
4. ✅ T8.4: Create shadows as wireframe blocks:
   - Use wireframeBlockMaker (wfb)
   - Same edge width as rubix cube blocks (0.1)
   - **Color**: Light green (0.5, 1, 0.5) with 50% transparency
   - **Edge Color**: Light green
   - **Parent**: Inside RubixCube model
5. ✅ T8.5: Fixes
   1. ✅ add a buffer to shadow blocks so they extend 4 units wider on each side than the blocks they represent
   2. ✅ make center black transp = .8
   3. ✅ order of positioning
      1. ✅ passed in origin = GB baseplate center
      2. ✅ shadow layer bottom is 0.1 above GB baseplate top
      3. ✅ RC bottom is 2 above shadow layer top
   4. ✅ rename the GB baseplate to foundation
   5. ✅ foundation should be centered directly under RC
   6. ✅ name the Model around the shadow lanes, XParallelShadowLanes
   7. ✅ create a similar group called ZParallelShadowLanes at the same Y so they form a grid when viewed from above 
   8. ✅ create a test block at this position
      9. ✅ X: -50, Y: 7.199999809265137, Z: -40
      10. ✅ Size: 1,50,1 - blue concrete material 
   11. ✅ it looks like the RC is not centered.  it looks like it is off by 1 block in the z direction.  investigate and fix
   12. ✅ remove the debugging block and print statements
   13. ✅ new blocks in GB
      1. ✅ add a method to RCService called calcXZShadowDimensions - use this to calculate the size of a new block called platform, and is a WF block coincident with foundation top
         1. ✅ color, pink, transp = .5
      2. ✅ XZWall
         3. ✅ new wf block coincident with platform block
         4. ✅ size - same as platform block + 50 units in x and z
         5. ✅ can collide = true  
         6. ✅ transp = 0
         7. ✅ change dimension adder to 20d

14. ✅ modify wfmaker to accept this object:

``` overRideProps: {
mainBlock: {},
edges: {},
}
   1. ✅ from RCmaker, pass in transp: .5 for the main block, and .9 for the edges

15. ✅ Vertical walls 
   1. ✅ create XYWall and ZYWall
      2. ✅ each at one of the edges of XZWall, 1 unit thick, so that the 3 walls form a partial box

16. ✅ New Shadow Lanes
   17. ✅ renaming and grouping
      1. ✅ rename XParallelShadowLanes to XParallelShadowLanesInXZ
      2. ✅ rename ZParallelShadowLanes to ZParallelShadowLanesInXZ
      3. ✅ group them in a model called XZShadowLanes
   18. ✅ create an analogous set of shadow lanes, using the same structure, projected onto the XY wall
   19. ✅ create an analogous set of shadow lanes, using the same structure, projected onto the ZY wall
   20. ✅ set wall color to light blue
17. WFBM update - panels
   18.   update WFBM so the user can pass in panels object like this:
```
panels = {front: true, etc}
```

   19. And 
   20. copy the structure of WFBM
      20.   there will be a main cube in the middle
      21.   instead of additional blocks that define the edges, create a set of additional blocks that define the faces
      22.
