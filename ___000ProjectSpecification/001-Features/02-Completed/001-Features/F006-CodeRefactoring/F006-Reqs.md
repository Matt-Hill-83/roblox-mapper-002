# Feature 006: Code Refactoring Requirements

## R75: Route.js Refactoring

1. ✅ [CLD2] R75.1: The system shall move logic to a folder lib/generateData/ and a file generateData
2. ✅ [CLD2] R75.2: The system shall separate files for constants
3. ✅ [CLD2] R75.3: The system shall separate files for interfaces
4. ✅ [CLD2] R75.4: The system shall separate files for utils

## Page.jsx Cleanup Requirements

1. ✅ Consolidate Collapse State Management: The multiple `useState` hooks and `handleToggle` functions for panel collapse (`isTableCollapsed`, `isReactFlowCollapsed`, etc.) could be consolidated into a single state object or a custom hook for better organization and less repetition
2. ✅ Extract API Logic: The `useEffect` and `handleConfigSubmit` functions contain direct API calls. This logic could be extracted into a separate service or hook (`useHierarchyData`) to improve separation of concerns and reusability
3. ✅ Centralize Default Config: The `config` default values are hardcoded. These could be moved to a separate constant or configuration file for easier management and to avoid magic numbers/strings
4. ✅ Simplify `getFlexValue`: While functional, `getFlexValue` is a very small helper. Consider if its direct inline usage or a more generic utility for dynamic styles would be clearer
5. ✅ Refine JSX Structure: The nested `Box` and `Grid` components, especially with inline `sx` props, can become deeply nested and hard to read. Consider breaking down complex sections into smaller, dedicated components
6. ✅ Consistent Styling: Some styles are applied via `sx` prop, others via `style` prop (`boxStyles`). Standardize on one approach, preferably `sx` for Material-UI components, and consider moving complex styles to a theme or `styled` components
7. ✅ Remove Commented-Out Code: Lines like `// width: '100%',` and `// border: "10px solid red",` should be removed
