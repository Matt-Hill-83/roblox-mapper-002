# Feature 009: Animation Between Layouts Summary

## Overview
Smooth animation system for transitioning between different layout configurations in the Roblox 3D hierarchical graph visualization. This feature enables users to dynamically switch between various spatial arrangements while maintaining visual continuity through animated transitions.

## Key Components
- **Layout State Management**: Store and manage multiple layout configurations
- **Animation Engine**: Smooth interpolation between node positions
- **Transition Effects**: Visual effects during layout changes
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient animation calculations for large graphs
- **User Controls**: Interface for selecting and triggering layout transitions

## Implementation Status
- ⬛ Requirements defined
- ⬛ Implementation pending

## Technical Approach
- Use TweenService for smooth position transitions
- Maintain node UUID consistency across layouts
- Implement easing functions for natural movement
- Handle connector updates during animation
- Support partial graph animations

## Dependencies
- Roblox TweenService
- Existing layout calculation systems
- Node positioning services
- Configuration GUI for controls
