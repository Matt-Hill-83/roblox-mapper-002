# Feature 011: WebBased 3D Chart Animated Pivot Data Structure

## Overview
Interactive 3D visualization system with animated transitions for pivoting hierarchical data structures in real-time. This feature enables users to dynamically reorganize and view entity relationships from different perspectives through smooth 3D animations.

## Key Components
- **3D Pivot Engine**: Dynamic reorganization of entity hierarchies based on selected pivot criteria
- **Animation System**: Smooth transitions between different data arrangements
- **Interactive Controls**: User interface for selecting pivot points and animation parameters
- **Multi-Axis Pivoting**: Support for pivoting on entity type, relationships, or custom attributes
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient rendering and animation of large datasets

## Implementation Goals
- Seamless transitions when changing data perspectives
- Real-time interaction with 3D visualization
- Support for complex hierarchical transformations
- Maintain visual context during animations
- Optimize for smooth performance with 1000+ entities

## Technical Architecture
- **SciChart 3D**: Core visualization engine
- **Animation Framework**: Custom interpolation system for smooth transitions
- **State Management**: Efficient data structure transformations
- **WebGL Optimization**: Hardware-accelerated rendering

## User Experience
- Intuitive pivot point selection
- Configurable animation speed and easing
- Visual indicators for pivot axes
- Smooth camera transitions
- Maintain entity selection during pivots
