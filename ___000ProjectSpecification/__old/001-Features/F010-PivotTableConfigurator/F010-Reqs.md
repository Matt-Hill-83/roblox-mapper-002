# Feature 010: Pivot Table Layout Configurator Requirements

## R83: Pivot Table Style Configuration Interface

1. ⬛ R83.1: The system shall provide a drag-and-drop interface for mapping properties to visual features
   1. ⬛ R83.1.1: Display all available entity properties in a property panel
   2. ⬛ R83.1.2: Show geometric dimension slots (X, Y, Z, Size, Color, Shape)
   3. ⬛ R83.1.3: Allow dragging properties to dimension slots
   4. ⬛ R83.1.4: Support removing mappings by dragging out

2. ⬛ R83.2: The system shall support dynamic property discovery
   1. ⬛ R83.2.1: Automatically detect all properties from loaded entities
   2. ⬛ R83.2.2: Categorize properties by data type (string, number, boolean)
   3. ⬛ R83.2.3: Show property statistics (unique values, range, distribution)
   4. ⬛ R83.2.4: Update property list when data changes

3. ⬛ R83.3: The system shall implement flexible mapping rules
   1. ⬛ R83.3.1: Map numerical properties to continuous dimensions (position, size)
   2. ⬛ R83.3.2: Map categorical properties to discrete features (color, shape)
   3. ⬛ R83.3.3: Support property transformations (log scale, normalization)
   4. ⬛ R83.3.4: Allow compound mappings (multiple properties to one dimension)

4. ⬛ R83.4: The system shall provide real-time visualization updates
   1. ⬛ R83.4.1: Regenerate graph immediately when mappings change
   2. ⬛ R83.4.2: Highlight affected nodes during configuration
   3. ⬛ R83.4.3: Show preview of changes before applying
   4. ⬛ R83.4.4: Support undo/redo for configuration changes

5. ⬛ R83.5: The system shall enable configuration management
   1. ⬛ R83.5.1: Save custom mapping configurations
   2. ⬛ R83.5.2: Load previously saved configurations
   3. ⬛ R83.5.3: Share configurations between users
   4. ⬛ R83.5.4: Provide default configuration templates
