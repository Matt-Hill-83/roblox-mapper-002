# F002 Code Integration Progress

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### Phase 1: Property Value Resolution Integration
- ‚úÖ T1.1: Updated UnifiedDataRenderer to use PropertyValueResolver
  - Replaced duplicate getNodePropertyValue methods
  - Integrated PropertyValueResolver instance
  - Removed redundant property extraction logic

- ‚úÖ T1.2: Updated PositionCalculator to use PropertyValueResolver
  - Integrated PropertyValueResolver for all property extraction
  - Replaced getNodePropertyValue calls with propertyResolver.getPropertyValue
  - Added country properties support

- ‚úÖ T1.3: Checked LabelRenderer
  - No changes needed - doesn't extract properties

### Phase 2: Constants Integration
- ‚úÖ T2.1: Replaced magic numbers with POSITION_CONSTANTS
  - Updated MIN_GROUND_CLEARANCE usage (5 ‚Üí POSITION_CONSTANTS.MIN_GROUND_CLEARANCE)
  - Updated Z_AXIS_SPACING usage (5 ‚Üí POSITION_CONSTANTS.Z_AXIS_SPACING)

- ‚úÖ T2.2: Replaced magic numbers in block creators
  - Updated flatBlockCreator.ts to use BLOCK_CONSTANTS
  - Replaced all hardcoded dimensions, colors, and materials
  - Added POSITION_CONSTANTS import for spacing values

- ‚úÖ T2.3: Updated label creators to use LABEL_CONSTANTS
  - Created new LABEL_CONSTANTS file
  - Updated labelBlockMaker to use constants
  - Updated labelRenderer to use LABEL_CONSTANTS
  - Updated labelGroupMaker to use constants

### Phase 3: Block Creation Integration
- ‚úÖ T3.1: Created blockCreatorAdapter.ts
  - Provides compatibility layer between old API and new modular creators
  - Maintains existing function signatures
  - Uses new PlatformBlockCreator, ShadowBlockCreator, SwimLaneBlockCreator

- ‚úÖ T3.2: Replaced imports in UnifiedDataRenderer
  - Updated to use adapter functions
  - No changes to calling code required
  - Build successful

## Remaining Tasks üìã

### Phase 4: Position Calculator Integration (Low Priority)
- ‚è≥ T4.1: Create adapter for refactored PositionCalculator
- ‚è≥ T4.2: Integrate BoundsCalculator
- ‚è≥ T4.3: Integrate NodeOrganizer
- ‚è≥ T4.4: Integrate PositionMapper

### Phase 5: Feature-Specific Integration (High Priority)
- ‚è≥ T5.1: Update Y-axis property positioning
- ‚è≥ T5.2: Update visual customization
- ‚è≥ T5.3: Update node properties inspector
- ‚è≥ T5.4: Update connectivity validation

## Integration Status

The refactored code has been successfully integrated into the active codebase:
1. **PropertyValueResolver** is now being used for all property extraction
2. **Constants** have replaced magic numbers throughout the rendering pipeline
3. **Block creators** are being used via the adapter layer
4. All builds are passing with no TypeScript errors

## Next Steps

The high-priority Phase 5 tasks should be addressed next to ensure new features properly use the refactored code. Phase 4 can be deferred as it involves more significant refactoring with higher risk.
