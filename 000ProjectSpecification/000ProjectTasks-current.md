31. ✅ clean up page.jsx

    1. ✅ Consolidate Collapse State Management: The multiple `useState` hooks and `handleToggle` functions for panel collapse (`isTableCollapsed`, `isReactFlowCollapsed`, etc.) could be consolidated into a single state object or a custom hook for better organization and less repetition.
    2. ✅ Extract API Logic: The `useEffect` and `handleConfigSubmit` functions contain direct API calls. This logic could be extracted into a separate service or hook (`useHierarchyData`) to improve separation of concerns and reusability.
    3. ✅ Centralize Default Config: The `config` default values are hardcoded. These could be moved to a separate constant or configuration file for easier management and to avoid magic numbers/strings.
    4. ✅ Simplify `getFlexValue`: While functional, `getFlexValue` is a very small helper. Consider if its direct inline usage or a more generic utility for dynamic styles would be clearer.
    5. ✅ Refine JSX Structure: The nested `Box` and `Grid` components, especially with inline `sx` props, can become deeply nested and hard to read. Consider breaking down complex sections into smaller, dedicated components.
    6. ✅ Consistent Styling: Some styles are applied via `sx` prop, others via `style` prop (`boxStyles`). Standardize on one approach, preferably `sx` for Material-UI components, and consider moving complex styles to a theme or `styled` components.
    7. ✅ Remove Commented-Out Code: Lines like `// width: '100%',` and `// border: "10px solid red",` should be removed.

32. ✅ [GEM] R69: The system shall implement MUI Accordion components:

    1. ✅ [GEM] R69.1: Replace `CollapsibleGraphPanel` with MUI `Accordion`, `AccordionSummary`, and `AccordionDetails`.
    2. ✅ [GEM] R69.2: Update imports in `hierarchy-tester/page.tsx` to include MUI Accordion components.
    3. ✅ [GEM] R69.3: Map `isCollapsed` and `onToggle` from `usePanelCollapse` to `expanded` and `onChange` props of `Accordion`.
    4. ✅ [GEM] R69.4: Place content previously rendered by `CollapsibleGraphPanel`'s `switch` case directly into `AccordionDetails`.
    5. ✅ [GEM] R69.5: Adjust layout and styling to ensure visual consistency with the new Accordion structure.
    6. ✅ [GEM] R69.6: Remove the `CollapsibleGraphPanel.tsx` component file.

33. ✅ [CLD] R70 UI collapser fixes:
34. ✅ [CLD] R70.1: Make element shown in image expand to fill the width of the container. 2. ✅ [CLD] R70.2: Give the element a 10px red border.
