# Feature 009: Animation Between Layouts Requirements

## R82: Layout Animation System

1. ⬛ R82.1: The system shall support smooth transitions between different layout configurations
   1. ⬛ R82.1.1: Animate node positions using Roblox TweenService
   2. ⬛ R82.1.2: Support configurable animation duration (0.5 to 5 seconds)
   3. ⬛ R82.1.3: Implement multiple easing functions (Linear, Quad, Cubic, Bounce)

2. ⬛ R82.2: The system shall maintain visual continuity during transitions
   1. ⬛ R82.2.1: Keep node UUIDs consistent across layout changes
   2. ⬛ R82.2.2: Update connectors dynamically during animation
   3. ⬛ R82.2.3: Prevent visual glitches or node overlap during transition

3. ⬛ R82.3: The system shall support multiple predefined layout types
   1. ⬛ R82.3.1: Hierarchical tree layout (current default)
   2. ⬛ R82.3.2: Circular/radial layout by entity type
   3. ⬛ R82.3.3: Grid layout with type-based grouping
   4. ⬛ R82.3.4: Force-directed graph layout
   5. ⬛ R82.3.5: Custom user-defined layouts

4. ⬛ R82.4: The system shall provide animation controls in the GUI
   1. ⬛ R82.4.1: Layout selection dropdown menu
   2. ⬛ R82.4.2: Animation speed slider
   3. ⬛ R82.4.3: Play/pause/reset animation buttons
   4. ⬛ R82.4.4: Preview of target layout before animation

5. ⬛ R82.5: The system shall optimize performance for large graphs
   1. ⬛ R82.5.1: Batch node updates to reduce lag
   2. ⬛ R82.5.2: Implement level-of-detail during animation
   3. ⬛ R82.5.3: Support cancellation of in-progress animations
   4. ⬛ R82.5.4: Limit concurrent animations to maintain 30+ FPS
