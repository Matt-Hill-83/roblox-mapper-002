# Feature 006: Code Refactoring Tasks

## T125: Route.js Refactoring (R75)

125. ✅ [CLD2] T125: Route.js Refactoring (R75)
     1. ✅ [CLD2] Move logic to lib/generateData/ folder and create generateData file (R75.1)
     2. ✅ [CLD2] Extract constants to separate constants file (R75.2)
     3. ✅ [CLD2] Extract interfaces to separate interfaces file (R75.3)
     4. ✅ [CLD2] Extract utils to separate utils file (R75.4)

## T81-T89: Page.jsx Cleanup Tasks

81. ✅ T81: Consolidate Collapse State Management: The multiple `useState` hooks and `handleToggle` functions for panel collapse could be consolidated into a single state object or a custom hook for better organization and less repetition

82. ✅ T82: Extract API Logic: The `useEffect` and `handleConfigSubmit` functions contain direct API calls. This logic could be extracted into a separate service or hook (`useHierarchyData`) to improve separation of concerns and reusability

83. ✅ T83: Centralize Default Config: The `config` default values are hardcoded. These could be moved to a separate constant or configuration file for easier management and to avoid magic numbers/strings

84. ✅ T84: Simplify `getFlexValue`: While functional, `getFlexValue` is a very small helper. Consider if its direct inline usage or a more generic utility for dynamic styles would be clearer

85. ✅ T85: Refine JSX Structure: The nested `Box` and `Grid` components, especially with inline `sx` props, can become deeply nested and hard to read. Consider breaking down complex sections into smaller, dedicated components

86. ✅ T86: Consistent Styling: Some styles are applied via `sx` prop, others via `style` prop (`boxStyles`). Standardize on one approach, preferably `sx` for Material-UI components, and consider moving complex styles to a theme or `styled` components

87. ✅ T87: Remove Commented-Out Code: Lines like `// width: '100%',` and `// border: "10px solid red",` should be removed

88. ✅ T88: [VSC] update this file to say "vscode test" at the top

89. ✅ T89: [VSC] update this file to say "copilot test" at the top
