# Simple 2D Hierarchical Graph Console Demo Specification

## Summary

Create a minimal proof of concept that demonstrates hierarchical data analysis and 2D positioning as a Node.js console application.

   26. ✅ R60: The system shall implement table tweaks:

       1. ✅ Make the suggested configurations table expand vertically to show all rows

   27. ✅ [GEM] R61: The system shall add 2 more columns to main layout:

       1. ✅ [GEM] Currently the react flow chart is in a large pane with a min/max button. Add the cyto and d3 graphs to similar panes, each with a min/max button.
       2. ✅ [GEM] Remove the mini versions of all 3 graphs.

   28. ✅ [GEM] R62: The system shall implement suggested configurations table tweaks:

   30. ✅ Revert Roblox Code to Working Version:

       2. ✅ R65: We made some changes to this file that I didn't like, but we committed them and then kept building.
       3. ✅ R66: We added an entire Next.js app to the project and committed it.
       4. ✅ R67: Now, I want to work on the Roblox part again and revert the Roblox code back to the working state without changing the Next.js code.
       5. ✅ R68: I think the two apps are mostly separate.

   31. ✅ clean up page.jsx
       1. ✅ Consolidate Collapse State Management: The multiple `useState` hooks and `handleToggle` functions for panel collapse (`isTableCollapsed`, `isReactFlowCollapsed`, etc.) could be consolidated into a single state object or a custom hook for better organization and less repetition.
       2. ✅ Extract API Logic: The `useEffect` and `handleConfigSubmit` functions contain direct API calls. This logic could be extracted into a separate service or hook (`useHierarchyData`) to improve separation of concerns and reusability.
       3. ✅ Centralize Default Config: The `config` default values are hardcoded. These could be moved to a separate constant or configuration file for easier management and to avoid magic numbers/strings.
       4. ✅ Simplify `getFlexValue`: While functional, `getFlexValue` is a very small helper. Consider if its direct inline usage or a more generic utility for dynamic styles would be clearer.
       5. ✅ Refine JSX Structure: The nested `Box` and `Grid` components, especially with inline `sx` props, can become deeply nested and hard to read. Consider breaking down complex sections into smaller, dedicated components.
       6. ✅ Consistent Styling: Some styles are applied via `sx` prop, others via `style` prop (`boxStyles`). Standardize on one approach, preferably `sx` for Material-UI components, and consider moving complex styles to a theme or `styled` components.
       7. ✅ Remove Commented-Out Code: Lines like `// width: '100%',` and `// border: "10px solid red",` should be removed.
